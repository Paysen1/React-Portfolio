# React + Vite

I have learned a great deal from this challenge. Firstly, I was making to many components until I looked back in the activites and found a perfect way to stucture my app that mad e things a lot easier to understand. Importing was a little challange at first and so was deploying with nelify, but overall was a fun application to build and I loved working with REACT!
